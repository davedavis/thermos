        <h1>Welcome to Thermos.ie</h1>
        <p>Thermos is Dave's bookmarking tool. It's just a test and is not for production. This is just
            my attempt to learn Flask and try to build one of my backlogged projects. This big test will
            come when the transfer to nginx happens.

        <h3>Learn more by signing up</h3>
        <p>Eventually, this will be used to implement a singup, login or anonymous bookmark signup but
            I don't expect any users. This is for me. I'd like to include oAuth signup and sync. I might
            also use this section to include :ToDo items to keep them fresh in my mind. .</p>
